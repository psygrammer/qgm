    "Suppose two cues, A and B, are presented to a learner, followed by an outcome. Typically both cues will acquire moderate associative strength with the outcome. On the other hand, if the subject was trained in a previous phase to learn that A by itself predicts the outcome, then the associative strength from B seems to be very weak. It appears that the prior training with A has blocked, i.e. prevented, learning about B, despite the fact that B is now just as predictive of the outcome as A. "
